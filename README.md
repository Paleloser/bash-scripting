# bash-scripting
Fun #!/bin/bash scripts!

## bananas.sh
Reverse shell script. Once runned stablishes a tunnel from the victim to your computer, wich 
previously should be listening on desired port (Netcat needed).

## whereami.sh
Doxing script: gets info about local network. Imagine you connect your laptop somewhere, with
this you'd get info about hosts connected, public IP and Whois. Even if you're lucky and stay
enough time you could get a fully agressive scan of the network (uses nmap, whois and curl).
